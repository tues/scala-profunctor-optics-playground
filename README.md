# scala-profunctor-optics-playground

These are just some quick and random experiments inspired by reading about profunctor optics.
The code is very messy. It's a code equivalent of "stream of consciousness". **Please ignore unless you know what you're looking for**.
Most importantly: don't use this as a guide on how to write good Scala code ;)

I will probably rewrite all of this to be semi-usable and more readable, eventually.
